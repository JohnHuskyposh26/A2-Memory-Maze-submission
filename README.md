General Info
Memory Maze was created to enhance problem-solving and memory skills through gameplay. The purpose of this project is to build a challenging game where players need to remember disappearing paths while avoiding obstacles to reach the goal. The game was inspired by classic memory puzzles and maze games, with a goal of pushing players' abilities to memorise under pressure.

Technologies Used
MakeCode Arcade - Version 1.0
Python (MakeCode Arcade adaptation)

Features
4 mazes to complete: fail and the player restarts at the first maze
Disappearing Paths: Paths fade after the player moves, requiring memory to navigate the maze.
Difficulty Selection: Allows players to set the game difficulty (affecting lives and countdown timer).
Life and Scoring System: Player loses lives upon collision with walls, with scoring based on completion time.
High Score Tracker: Saves the best score achieved in the game session
